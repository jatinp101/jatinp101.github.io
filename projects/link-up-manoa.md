## What is Link-Up-Manoa?

Link-Up-Manoa is platform created for students to create study groups and join study groups that maybe of interest along with connecting with other students that are in their major and taking the same classes. This platform is great for students at UH Manoa because of how large classes sizes are it can be difficult to meet other student and collaborate. Even though we have the ICSpace as a space where students in ICS can meet and collaborate. Link-Up-Manoa takes advantage of the study spaces and allows students to view when and where study groups are in the below image.

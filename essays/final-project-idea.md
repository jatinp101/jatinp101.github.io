# Project: Campus Food and Beverage Delivery

## The Problem

With students of this day in age expect things to be delivered to them really quickly with apps like amazon prime having to wait for food is a chore in their day. Solutions that are currently available are individual chains having apps where they can come into the shop and pick up the food but the issue is additionally having to make the trip to the shop adds time. But although there are apps like Uber Eats and Grubhub but they don't cater on university campuses besides take out. Additionally this can make the lives of students easier as UH Manoa is a decently sized campus which takes a while to traverse. 

## The Solution

A solution is a Uber Eats exclusively for the UH Manoa campus. This being where the user can log into the site and view their previous orders and reorder the previous orders and confirm the location from the same page. From there if the user wants to order something different there will be an order button in the Navigation bar where it will first ask which food establishment the user wants to order from when they select that then it will ask which menu items it would like and additionally if the user wants to order from another food establishment to add to the order. From there the user will be prompted with where they would like the food to be delivered to. 

## Why is this needed

As UH is a large campus it can possibly take students approximately 20 minutes to go and grab food from the other side of campus at their favourite food establishment. This can cut useless time for the student to commute from one end such as POST & Holmes to the Manoa Dining Services near Sinclair and the wait to purchase food. Additionally this can be helpful like when you're sitting inside and it is raining and you do not want to go outside and get sick but are hungry.  

## Mockup Page Ideas

Some possible mockup pages include:

<li>Landing Page</li>
<li>User Home Page</li>
<li>Admin Home Page</li>
<li>Food Vendors Home Page</li>
<li>Recent Orders Page</li>
<li>New Orders Page</li>
<li>Select Food Vendors Page</li>
<li>Select Food Item Page</li>
<li>Select Delivery Location Page</li>
<li>Create Food Item Page</li>
<li>Create Food Menu Page</li>
<li>Receive food orders page</li>

## Use Case Ideas

Basic functionality use cases: 

<li>New user gets landing page, logs in, gets to home page with instructions on how to order if no orders have been made in the past</li>
<li>User gets landing page, logs in, orders from recent orders page, selects which building the food will be delivered to</li>
<li>User gets landing page, logs in, orders new orders page, selects food vendor, selects food item, selects delivery location</li>
<li>Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site</li>
<li>Food Vendor gets landing page, gets home page, updates menu</li>
<li>Food Vendor gets landing page, gets home page, adds menu</li>
<li>Food Vendor gets landing page, gets home page, adds food item</li>
<li>Food Vendor gets landing page, gets home page, get food orders</li>

## Beyond the Basics

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

<li>Let user pick between using google maps to deliver to users location or a specific location on UH campus</li>
<li>Allow campus meal card to be used on the app</li>
<li>Allow voice assistants to order meals</li>

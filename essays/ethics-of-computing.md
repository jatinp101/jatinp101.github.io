## Ethics in Relation to Software Engineering 

Ethics in the context of Software Engineering means developing systems that will not affect society in a negative way. The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) lines out guidelines for ethics in Computer Science: 1. General Ethical Principles, 2. Professional Responsibilities, 3. Professional Leadership Principles, and 4. Compliance with the Code. These are guidelines Software Engineers should follow to remain not just and effective Software Engineer but also an Ethical Software Engineer. The case study I took a look at was this article titled <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/#.tsjl7lkxy">"The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of"</a> by Bill Sourour. 

## Misleading Survey

In the article Bill Sourour writes about how when he got his first full-time software he wrote code up for a site which was a survey but was intended to sell teenage girls prescription drugs. He writes about how the requirements for the software were to create a survey where no matter what the user entered it would show the user the specific drug except when the user entered that either they were already taking it or they had an allergy. Later on he writes that one day he got invited to steak dinner he ended up going where he found out through an email from a colleague about a teen who took her own life due to the drug. When he heard about the incident he ended up resigning it also turned out his sister happened to be taking the drug also in which he told her to stop taking. 

## What Should Have Been Done?

The ethical thing to do was at the beginning to question the ethical nature of the requirements at the beginning with the client. For example, possibly asking the client to provide more possibilities besides the two filters to keep certain people away from the drug. Another ethical action he could have taken was to ask the client to give him the side effects of the drugs and where to place the side effects to let the user be informed about the side effects of the drug. If the client did not give the engineer what he needed to create the site ethically he could walk away from the project. Overall, Software Engineering and Ethics go hand in hand as we saw in the case study where greed by a pharmaceutical company had software engineers to build a site where the engineers did not realize the ethical issue with what they were building that when they found out it was too late.

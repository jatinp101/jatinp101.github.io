## Isn't it the same though?

When first starting my journey into JavaScript I expected it to be similar to Java syntax wise just like as when I learned how to program in C/C++. But when going into the depths of JavaScript I was decieved to find another way to declare classes and a different way to create structures. Add on top of that the idea that a variable can be any data type is a blessing and a curse in a way. With all these features it makes JavaScript a language that divides many programmers in to two seperate camps those who love JavaScript and those who think it sucks.

## Out with the old in with the new

Prior to this class I did work with a little bit of JavaScript for things such as my job as an Assistant Front End Developer but I was confused most of the time by the syntax being used. For example, using "let" and "const" instead of just using "var" for variables. But when I first started to do the exercies in freecodecamp for JavaScript ES6 it made more sense that the JavaScript that I worked with was a newer and better way of working with JavaScript. When I finished the freecodecamp course I had a greater amount of knowledge of JavaScript and started to love more of the simplicity of the language.

## Athletic Software Engineering???

In this course ICS 314 Software Engineering a certain type of pedagogy is being being used called Athletic Software Engineering(ASE). Although it may sound strange at first but it is one of the most interesting ways that I have learned to program so far. In the class the professor refers to it as the Workout of the Day or (WOD). It essentially gets students to look at programming problems and makes them able to solve the problem within a certain timeframe. If the student programs the question correctly within a certain time then the student recieves all the points if either the program is not correct or the student does not finish in time the student recieves none of the points. I personally like the idea of this as it keeps me motivated to constantly want to do better although I can understand some of the concern how it can add unnecessary pressure to students who already have other pressures and commitments outside of the class but the professor tries to mitigate these worries with practice WOD's are done in groups in class and at home individually. Additionally TA's are also creating practice WOD sessions to help. Overall I believe this learning strategy is enjoyable because it forces students to be able to focus on details in programming while also trying to get faster at being able to program.

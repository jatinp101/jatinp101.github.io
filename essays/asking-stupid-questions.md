## What is the difference between "smart" and "not so smart" questions?

When you were in school the number one thing teachers would always say to students is "There is no such thing as a stupid question" additionally as a tutor who has helped students in Computer Science I know that although it is true there is no such thing as a stupid question I like to think that it is not the question you ask which is stupid but it is the <b> way </b> you asked the question which makes it stupid. Three main ways I believe a person can improve their "not so smart" question and make it "smart" is by making their question more explicit so that the person answering the question knows exactly what the problem is, adding more information that helps the person answering the question know what you have tried before asking the question, also finally is just being polite and not being entitled.

We want things now and with social media and services like Amazon Prime and Uber Eats we can recieve gratification faster than ever before.

A good example of this "not so smart" question is this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13575508/how-to-access-dynamic-generated-html-from-a-firefox-extension">post</a> from seven years ago. Not only is the question vague which but also can come off as entitled with using "Can anyone please help, this is urgent."

Did you also want to clean up your code without having to leave what you were doing to fix styling errors. Say no more now with IntelliJ and ESLint your worries are now resolved. Now if you make an error IntelliJ will instantly find the error and point it out with a red squiggle on the bottom of the error. As you can tell my first week using ESLint with IntelliJ have been great so far. Dealing with coding styles was not as painful as I imagined like how it is with checkstyle using Java.

## Checkstyle vs ESLint

Coming from using Checkstyle on Java to ESLint with Javascript is no comparison that ESLint is <b>BETTER</b>. In Java using Checkstyle was a pain rather than assisting you in making your code look cleaner it always felt like a nuisance. It constantly felt like with Checkstyle that you were having to babysit your code from looking like spaghetti to avoid any error with Checkstyle.

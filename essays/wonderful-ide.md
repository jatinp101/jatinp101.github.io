## This is very trivial

Before coming into this class and using an IDE such as IntelliJ I used JGrasp which was a barebones IDE which did the basics such as compiling, debugging, running programs, and checking the style of the code. When it came to checking the code with JGrasp the issue was that it nagged at you for certain coding errors and never really gave a clear enough explanation of what is wrong. So unfortunately my first experience to coding styles was ruined. But of course it did help me as it kept me in check by making sure that I did not cause any checkstyle errors. But by changing my IDE to IntelliJ it did help make it easier to fix the errors instead of having to manually go through each error and fix it.

## The best thing since sliced bread

Imagine the ability to program and your editor being able to catch all the errors you make without having to even run the code. Did you also want to clean up your code without having to leave what you were doing to fix styling errors. Say no more now with IntelliJ and ESLint your worries are now resolved. Now if you make an error IntelliJ will instantly find the error and point it out with a red squiggle on the bottom of the error. As you can tell my first week using ESLint with IntelliJ have been great so far. Dealing with coding styles was not as painful as I imagined like how it is with checkstyle using Java.

## Checkstyle vs ESLint

Coming from using Checkstyle on Java to ESLint with Javascript is no comparison that ESLint is <b>BETTER</b>. In Java using Checkstyle was a pain rather than assisting you in making your code look cleaner it always felt like a nuisance. It constantly felt like with Checkstyle that you were having to babysit your code from looking like spaghetti to avoid any error with Checkstyle. But with ESLint it no longer feels like you are babysitting your code instead ESLint with IntelliJ takes care of the babysitting and takes care of the most common style errors that programmers make and allows the programmer the control to take care of some errors which IntelliJ may not be able to handle on its own. But it is all worth it for that green check mark at the top right hand corner of the screen.

## That green checkmark

In IntelliJ there is a feature which checks all the Code Formatting plug-in's to see whether the code is formatted correctly and if IntelliJ finds that the code has been formatted correctly it will display a checkmark on the top right hand corner of the editor. Overall I feel like that it is pretty easy to get the green check mark but I can understand how at first it can be a learning curve in this class to get used to the new coding style.

## Coding Standards Matter

Overall coding standards matter as it can keep code from looking disorganized and messy. Solutions like checkstyle on JGrasp although yes do the trick and overtime gets the user to instinctively write neat code to avoid errors but overtime can start to nag the user. ESLint with IntelliJ so far looks like a happy medium for this problem but I can see how it can lead to complacency from the user to not bother to learn coding standards and rely on the plugin to take care of the issues for them.

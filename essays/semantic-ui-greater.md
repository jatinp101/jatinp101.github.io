## The Barriers of CSS

When I first learned UI design using HTML and CSS there was a lot to be desired. With my websites looking like they were made before Y2K and a sketchy site you would find on the tenth page of the search query on google it would not be something I would feel comfortable in using myself. But although they did not look nice one could try and fix it up with CSS which ended up becoming the band-aid for all the problems I faced in HTML. But along comes Semantic UI which makes the HTML and CSS process of creating a website easier. 

## What is Semantic UI?

Semantic UI is a framework that runs on top of HTML and CSS which takes HTML objects and adds a CSS class on top of the HTML object you want. The framework also can add different icons and buttons which can make the website look professional in less time than just only using HTML and CSS. Semantic UI also hosts different styles that allow the user to make changes to the icon to make new icons. For example, you are able to add a facebook icon and if you wanted to change the color of it from its original color of grey to blue you can. 

## Why use Semantic UI?

Using Semantic UI can make creating websites a lot easier without having to do the heavy work using CSS after creating all the HTML to make it "User Friendly" to the end user. What you will be doing with Semantic UI instead of using CSS to change features of HTML elements just add it to the ```div``` class items. To make other changes that Semantic UI cannot do you can use CSS to add things like padding and if Semantic UI does not allow for changing color on certain icons you can use CSS to override the default style. Overall Semantic UI makes it easy for developers to create websites which look professional and gets users to spend time on the page.

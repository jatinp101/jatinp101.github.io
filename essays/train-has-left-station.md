## We all start from somewhere

My first experience with programming was in community college as an IT major taking an introduction to programming class with C#. That was the class which piqued my interest into Software Engineering. From there I ended up changing my major from IT to Computer Science. From there I took my Computer Science classes and ended up doing a Software Engineering project with another classmate.

## So what now?

In this class I hope to persue more of my interest in Software Engineering and learn more about the subject. Additionally I am interested to learn about the different technologies that are used in the field. I am also excited this semester to work with other students on projects and network with those students who I may be working with in the future.

In the future I hope to apply the concepts I will be learning in this class. Additionally I hope to also work with my fellow classmates again on another project along with applying the leadership skills I will be learning in this class.

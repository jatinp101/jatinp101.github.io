## We all start from somewhere

Growing up I always enjoyed tinkering with computers. It always fascinated me that just by me writing a line of code on a document could make a computer do a certain action. My first experience with programming was in middle school when I tinkered with the macros inside Microsoft Word and Excel where I could figure out ways to make my computer do certain Math problems for me. From there when I attended community college as an IT major I took an introduction to programming class with C#. That was the class which piqued my interest into Software Engineering. From there I ended up changing my major from IT to Computer Science. From there I took my Computer Science classes and ended up doing a Software Engineering project with another classmate where we programmed a Timetable generator which makes Timetables for buildings.

## So what now?

In this class I hope to peruse more of my interest in Software Engineering and learn more about the subject. Additionally I am interested to learn about the different technologies that are used in the field. I am also excited this semester to work with other students on projects and network with those students who I may be working with in the future. I will also be working on two other projects this semester one being parallelizing the Timetable program I created. And the other being that I will be programming a drone to use artificial intelligence to go from one spot to another.

## Going on from here

In the future I hope to apply the technical and soft skills I will be learning in this class and in my current projects to my career and other projects I plan to take up in the future. I think also I believe that my interest in software engineering will grow. I also believe that my interest to tinker with computers will still be there and it will still grow.
